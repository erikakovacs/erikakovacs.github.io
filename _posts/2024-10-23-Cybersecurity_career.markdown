You have decided that you want to change your career to Cybersecurity. After that, you notice an advertisement on the internet. "Start your cybersecurity career without IT knowledge." This should be a red flag, but no worries! Here are 3 tips to consider before you pay and start an expensive bootcamp. Look into the following:

**1. Cybersecurity is not equal to ethical hacking.**

Cybersecurity has many areas, one of which is ethical hacking. You can deal with cryptography engineering, GRC consulting, Solution Engineering, Python Development and so on. From less technical areas to engineering fields. First of all, maybe you don't know what to choose, which fits for you. 

My tipp: 

Before you start a bootcamp look up what they might be involved in. Surely there is an area that has caught your interest?

**2. Python NOT As A Snake.**

If you have never programmed and have no idea how this works.

My tipp:

- What is useful for? 
- Just gather the terms you don't understand. (For example: for loop, while loop, string, etc.) Just make a list.
- Look at what Visual Studio Code or PyCharm is like. Check what parts and menus Visual Studio Code has, and what icons are available. You don't need to download it; just start a video on YouTube and pause it at the point when it starts. Just take a look at the top, side, and bottom to see what you can find.

**3. Make your own roadmap.**

What do you need to start your cybersecurity career? You need at least good English language skills and strong foundational professional knowledge, on which you can build in the future without the "house" collapsing.

My tipp:

Start sketching your own roadmap as you begin to formulate your thoughts. You can modify it later at any time, but have a complete overview. Determine where you will start and where you want to go. Don't use the roadmaps available on the internet, as they only showcase professional knowledge. 

- Set deadlines.
- Define the purpose of each step.

If, after reading the following article, you feel that some questions have arisen in your mind, then you are on the right track. Start today and spend at least 5 minutes on it every day.

**Plus one tip: Donâ€™t let yourself be distracted from the path.**
